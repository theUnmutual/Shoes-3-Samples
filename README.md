# Shoes-3-Samples
Sample programs for Shoes 3. Super easy. No, easier than that. 

This repository contains Shoes 3.2 (federales) samples.

I wrote them to teach myself little bits of the code, before working up to big programs with complicated stuff going on.

Generally, I found that even though Shoes is The Easy GUI, it's still not all that easy for beginners - there is a lack of good tutorials.

Please read, and reuse the code if it's helpful.
