# Shoes-3-Samples
_Shoes 3.2 (federales) samples. Super easy. No, easier than that._
##################################################################################

Even though Shoes is The Easy GUI, it's still not all that easy for beginners - there is a lack of good tutorials, and it's no longer well supported. I was asking super basic questions like "how do I save inputted data as variables???". 

I wrote them to teach myself little bits of the code, before working up to big programs with complicated stuff going on.

Please read, and reuse the code if it's helpful.

##The Programs

**Form 1: Drag Queen Management**
Gives you incorrect information about a drag queen. You input correct information. These variables overwrite the old ones, and are displayed.

Demonstrates how to turn an input into a variable.
Demonstrates using custom classes in Shoes.

**Form 2: The Apologiser**
Generates the text of an apology. You input what you are sorry for, and how sorry you are.

Demonstrates how to use every input element in Shoes: edit_box, edit_line, checkbox, slider etc. 
It does not currently demonstrate radios. I'm stuck on those.
