# Shoes-3-Samples
_Shoes 3.2 (federales) samples. Super easy. No, easier than that._
##################################################################################

Even though Shoes is The Easy GUI, it's still not all that easy for beginners - there is a lack of good tutorials, and it's no longer well supported. I was asking super basic questions like "how do I save inputted data as variables???". 

I wrote them to teach myself little bits of the code, before working up to big programs with complicated stuff going on.

Please read, and reuse the code if it's helpful.

##FORMS

**Form 1: Drag Queen Management**
Gives you incorrect information about a drag queen. You input correct information. These variables overwrite the old ones, and are displayed.

Demonstrates how to turn an input into a variable.
Demonstrates using custom classes in Shoes.

**Form 2: The Apologiser**
Generates the text of an apology. You input what you are sorry for, and how sorry you are.

Demonstrates how to use every input element in Shoes: edit_box, edit_line, checkbox, slider etc. 
It does not currently demonstrate radios. I'm stuck on those.

##LAYOUT

**Display 1: Tabs**
Three hidden stacks. As you click different choices, the stacks appear and disappear. 

**Display 2: Linked Pages**
This app demonstrates how to create interlinked pages on Shoes. It's copied straight from the Nobody Knows Shoes book. 

**Display 3: Windows**
Another way to layout your information is to put them on separate popup windows. This app pops up a window. It also shows how to make decisions in the window affect the main app page.

##APPEARANCE

**Appearance 1: Stylesheet**
Shows how to describe styles at the top of your app, and then apply them to everything. For example, redefining "para" as being always at font size 40 and in webdings font. 

(I want to create an example where you redefine Para entirely, anyone know how to do this?)

**Appearance 2: Use Para In Your Classes**
Say you have a fully functioning Ruby command line program and now want to make it pretty. You need to change every "puts" to "para", but you still get errors: no method found 'para' for Array Class; no method found 'alert' for YourCustomClass Class. 

Here's how to call Shoes methods like para, alert, edit_line etc, inside your classes.
